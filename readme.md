## Overview

![screenshot](./screenshot.png)

I have a good experience since it is a react render. It is very new for me so I got some problem when doing it.

I got the random quote from Get random quote url and displayed its properties on the browser after fecth. It works very well. 

The problem came when I tried to get all the quotes that are belong to the author name from random quote. When passing authorName to the Get quotes from a particular author url, there should be `authors/:authorName` as a path and `authors/{whoeverTheAuthorName}` as a link to get to all authorname's quotes, but I sttil used column `:` with `authors/{whoeverTheAuthorName}`. It was solved by taking off `:`.

I was so confused about accessing the author name to be displayed on the next page (all quotes that are owned by author name). However, I got it by spreading the data of the random quote on the list of all quotes file and access the author name iside of that file.
